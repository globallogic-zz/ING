Build Process Document
---------------------------

The build currently *ONLY* demonstrates the LESS compilation, JS & CSS minification, JS & CSS merging and Unit Testing. It doesn't currently creates a complete deployable application and it would be extended later on.

Software Requirement for build execution

1. JDK 1.5 (http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index_jdk5.jsp)
2. Maven 3.0.4 (http://apache.techartifact.com/mirror/maven/binaries/)

Installing/Configuring JDK 1.5

Please use the following URL for configuring JDK 1.5 on your system: http://wiki.indivohealth.org/index.php/Installing_And_Configuring_Java_-_Windows.

Installing/Configuring Maven 3

Steps To Execute/Verify the Build

1. Open the GitHub URL and navigate to the folder "ING Prototype".
2. Download the code and open the directory where the code is downloaded.
3. Click on build.bat.
4. A folder named "target" will get created. 
5. The build.bat uses maven to compile the less file into the css file. The source folder of less file is /"ING Prototype"/less and the compiled file is created in /target/lesscss folder
6. The build.bat uses maven-minify-plugin to minify and merge the js files. The merge and minify js and css files are created in the folder /target/ING-Prototype/javascripts and /target/ING-Prototype/stylesheets folders.
